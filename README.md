# Mini Pokedex App

# Requirements
1. Pokemon API to use: https://pokeapi.co/
2. The app should be built in ReactJS. You can use a styling library like Emotion
3. The user should be able to search for a pokemon and gget a "card" filled with info about that pokemon
 - name, height, weight, types, abilities and base stats (hp/atk/def/special-atk/special-def/speed)
4. The card should have at least one picture/sprite of the pokemon
5. Stage the app on a live url

# Features
1. Match the pokemon type with the style of the card: red/gree, etc.
2. Style the pokemon stats
3. Show/click through all the spirtes of each pokemon, instead of just showing one
4. Display a few random pokemon upon loading before the user searches anything
5. Implement auto-complete options for possible pokemon matches as the user types their query
6. Use git to keep track of your progress with good commit messages throughout development
