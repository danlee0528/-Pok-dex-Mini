# Mini Pokedex App

# Requirements
- [x] Pokemon API to use: https://pokeapi.co/
- [x] The app should be built in ReactJS. You can use a styling library like Emotion
- [] The user should be able to search for a pokemon and gget a "card" filled with info about that pokemon: name, height, weight, types, abilities and base stats (hp/atk/def/special-atk/special-def/speed)
- [x] The card should have at least one picture/sprite of the pokemon
- [] Stage the app on a live url

# Features
- [x] Match the pokemon type with the style of the card: red/green, etc.
- [] Style the pokemon stats
- [x] Show/click through all the spirtes of each pokemon, instead of just showing one
- [] Display a few random pokemon upon loading before the user searches anything
- [] Implement auto-complete options for possible pokemon matches as the user types their query
- [x] Use git to keep track of your progress with good commit messages throughout development
